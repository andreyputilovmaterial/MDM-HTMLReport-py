# MDM-Diff-py
A new iteration of diff between MDD files, much cleaner, all in python. No mrs vbscript code and much less js, all should be in python

## Frequently asked questions
* Q: What do I need to run this?<br />A: You need python environment (any modern version) and IBM (Unicom) software that shoud be installed on your machine by default
* Q: Why the chosen language is python?<br />A: I can't write it all in mrs scripts in VBScript. This language is too limited and too stupid. So I had to go for some other alternative, and python is fine, it's a simple scripting language and it has all necessary dependencies. My earier attempts were to keep code partially in mrs scripts but then I realized everything can be done in python so it's easier to opt for one single language. Also I have some additions in JS but this is designed itentionally to add some unnecessary code that runs separately just to beautify the page at the very last stage, add more control over it, add the ability to show or hide columns. But all JS here is unnecessary and can be removed for simplification
* Q: Why are you doing this?<br />A: Everyone has some hobbies. I am not doing it at work/abor time. I find it interesting to find what we can do. It's some demonstrator of technologies. Maybe saying "tech" sounds too loud when I did not actually invent anything outstanding here - I am just reading fields utilizing existing API and writing it to HTML - nothing extraordinary - but I believe it can be developed to more sophisticated shapes.
